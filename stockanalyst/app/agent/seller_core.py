"""Seller core — the a2a-free seller logic + background delivery machinery.

This is the protocol-neutral heart of the ERC-8183 seller: the two fixed-code
operations (``negotiate`` → signed quote; ``notify_funded`` → verify → ACK →
deliver in the background) plus the background-delivery bookkeeping (``is_busy``,
the spawn/run/sweep helpers). It imports NOTHING from ``a2a`` so it can back any
transport — the A2A executor (``executor.py``) inherits it and wraps it with the
a2a wire, and a non-A2A HTTP entrypoint can call it directly without dragging in
``a2a-sdk``.

    negotiate     → ``signing.sign_quote`` (rule-based price clamp + EIP-191 sign)
    notify_funded → ``signing.verify_signed_job`` (fast on-chain gate) → ACK at
                    once, then in the BACKGROUND: LLM work → ``signing.submit_result``

``notify_funded`` is the buyer's "I funded job X — please deliver" notification.
Because the work takes time, it does NOT block the caller: it verifies the funded
job synchronously (a couple of eth_calls) to ACK accepted/rejected, then runs the
slow LLM work + on-chain ``submit`` in a background asyncio task and returns
immediately. The buyer reads the deliverable back from the CHAIN (SUBMITTED /
``get_deliverable_url``) — the chain is the source of truth. While any background
delivery is in flight :meth:`is_busy` reports busy, which the transport feeds to
AgentCore's ``/ping`` as ``HEALTHY_BUSY`` so the scale-to-zero runtime stays warm
until the work lands (within the session max-lifetime).

ALL signing is FIXED code in ``signing.py`` — NEVER an LLM-callable tool (money
is never in the LLM; the LLM only produces the work text, via the ``run_work``
hook). On each notification the core also opportunistically sweeps OTHER funded
jobs assigned to this provider — the buyer-push fallback for jobs whose buyer
funded on-chain but never sent ``notify_funded`` (deduped against in-flight jobs).
Negotiate stays sweep-free so quotes are fast. A periodic Lambda poller — which
also covers the scale-to-zero cold window when no one is invoking — is the v2
robust path.

You own this file — specialise the work hook / dispatch, but keep signing OUT of
the LLM tool list.

    prompt = f"""You are a senior equity analyst at a top-tier investment bank. \
A client has paid for a professional, actionable research report.

STOCKS TO ANALYZE: {symbol_list}
NUMBER OF STOCKS: {n_symbols} — you must produce a complete analyses entry for EACH one.
ANALYSIS TYPE: {analysis_type}
{context_section}
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
STAGE 1 — COLLECT ALL DATA (complete every call before writing)
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Call all five tools for EACH symbol, then call get_macro_context() once:

{symbol_checklist}
  + get_macro_context()  (once only)

Do not begin writing until every tool call above has returned a result.
NEVER fabricate a number — use only values returned by the tools.

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
STAGE 2 — OUTPUT JSON
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Your ENTIRE final response must be a single raw JSON object.
- Do NOT output any text before or after the JSON.
- Do NOT wrap it in markdown code fences (no ```json).
- Do NOT add comments inside the JSON.

The JSON must match this schema exactly:

{json_schema}

FIELD RULES:
1. analyses array must contain EXACTLY {n_symbols} entries, one per symbol in STOCKS TO ANALYZE.
   Symbols (in order): {symbol_list}
2. Use null for any field where the tool returned no data — never omit a field.
3. upside_catalysts and principal_risks must each have EXACTLY 3 items.
4. rating must be exactly "Buy", "Hold", or "Sell" (capital first letter, no other values).
5. risk_level must be exactly "Low", "Moderate", "High", or "Very High".
6. All prices and numbers must come verbatim from tool call results.
7. watchlist must have 3–5 entries of stocks NOT in the client's current portfolio.
8. risk_factors must have exactly 5 entries covering: Sector Concentration, Rate Sensitivity,
   Inter-Holding Correlation, Portfolio VaR (95%), Liquidity Risk.
